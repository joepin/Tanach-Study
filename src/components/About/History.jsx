          <p>It became apparent that our most important work to our nation had started to become neglected on some level. We all knew the Tanach was the backbone to our identity, but no one knew how to increase its study in a serious and sanctified manner.</p>
          <p>One morning in the Sephardic Rabbinical College, Rabbi Albert Setton announced that he took a new position at Kol Israel and wanted to teach over Sefer Yeshaya.</p>
          <p>Jesse quickly interjected, “What do you think of recording those perakim and using them to create an online platform to study all of Tanach?” With his affirmation, Jesse turned to Ovadia and said “We’ll get your dad to teach Yirmiyahu. Can you teach Yehezkel? And Josh, you’ll do Tere Asar?” Within 60 seconds there were commitments to teaching all of Nevi’im Aharonim, and with the hardest sefarim accounted for, Jesse knew that with a little effort he could help create a platform for a textual study of the entire Tanach. He set his mind to completing this mission, and ran from rabbi to rabbi and from educator to developer pitching the concept. Nearly everyone he approached identified with the idea and enthusiastically dedicated their time to make it a reality. With the help of a few dedicated young men and women a website was launched, texts were written and summarized, recordings were recorded, and the program was publicized. The program launched in October 2015 and grew to 1000 subscribers within a few weeks.</p>
          <p>Today we look back in amazement how a few inconsequential words and a strong will, turned into a long overdue Tanach study platform for the world to utilize.</p>
